Task management tools are common, but I wanted to build something that feels professional and production-ready. This project goes beyond simple CRUD by integrating secure authentication with cookies, hybrid rendering with Next.js (SSR + CSR), and global state management with Context to keep data consistent across the application.

Tech Stack at a Glance

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript (server-side + client-side rendering)

State Management: React Context (global variables and API data)

Authentication: Cookies (secure token + username storage)

Backend: Node.js + Express (structured API layer for tasks & auth)

Database: MongoDB

Containerization: Docker (deployment-ready setup)

This stack gave me both performance and security, while keeping the app scalable and maintainable.
